            <b>Unresolved Emotions</b><br><br><br>
            I want to scream at the top of my lungs,<br>
            But I can't seem to find my voice<br>
            I want to cry, to let it all out,<br>
            But my body isn't giving me a choice.<br><br> 
            
            My soul wants to relieve itself,<br>
            But my eyes won't release my tears.<br>
            How can I resolve all these emotions,<br>
            That I've had bottled up for years? <br><br>
            
            Years of suffering in silence<br>
            Suppressing my sorrows and pain.<br>
            Hiding from my past trauma,<br>
            When all I want is to be sane. <br><br>
            
            To break open the dam,<br>
            And release the flood of tears<br>
            To let go of the emotions,<br>
            That I've been holding in for years<br><br> 
            
            I want to be free,<br>
            From sorrows and regret.<br>
            But no matter how hard I try,<br>
            I still can't seem to forget.<br><br>
            
            Memories of humiliation<br>
            Rip a hole into my heart.<br>
            The pain is so unbearable.<br>
            It's tearing me apart.<br><br>
            
            All these bottled up emotions,<br>
            I wish I could express.<br>
            But, naturally, I hold it back.<br>
            Every feeling I suppress.<br><br>

        <h2>
            The Problem
        </h2>
        
        <p>The generation I was born into was not taught how to properly deal with their emotions. If a child has been in a situation which caused them great stress, anger, sadness, or any other emotional problem, most parents today would just say, "Leave it alone, and let it go", without actually trying to help bring closure to the situation or alleviate their unresolved emotions. Telling a child a phrase like this does not make things better. Instead, it just makes things worse as these feelings do not go anywhere, but are bottled up inside the person who was told to let them go. But why does this happen?</p> 
        
        <h2>
            The Cause
        </h2>

        <p>If someone had a really dirty or messy room, and another person told them to just leave it alone, would that help clean the room? No. The mess would stay there, but it will get worse. Just like unresolved emotions, anxiety, frustration and sadness build up overtime, if not handled properly, dirt and dust in a filthy room build up overtime and the mess becomes even harder to manage. We can't always let it go either -not immediately at least. It's not something we could just ignore. We can close the door and leave it alone if we want, but we will always be aware of the dirty room in our house. Out of sight doesn't always mean out of mind.</p> 
        <h2>
            The Effects
        </h2>
        
        <p>Similarly, we can try to forget about things that happened in the past, but the memories of the moments that hurt us the most can feel impossible to get rid of. Although, in many cases, we don't even remember what happened, we only remember how it made us feel.</p>
        <p class="quote">"People will forget the things you said. People will forget the things you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel." - Maya Angelou</p>
        <p>Not being able to explain where all of our unresolved emotions are coming from is one of the most painful feelings in the world.</p> 
        
        <h2>
            The Solution
        </h2>
        
        <p>That's why I think that, instead of forcing feelings away, we should take the time to try to clean up the mess in our heads before the situation reaches the point of no return. I'm not saying that we should hold onto every negative emotion we feel until it consumes us, but rather to address the issue and resolve the situation, instead of leaving it alone, only for it to come up again at the worst possible time. We can't let something go until we resolve it, and we can't resolve something if we just try to forget about it or leave it alone. When a child continuously brings up something that happened recently, or a long time ago, that still bothers them, most parents just assume that they are 'dwelling on the past' when, really, the child is just trying to find closure and settle an unresolved emotion they are feeling. I believe that these conversations should be encouraged, rather than discouraged, as these allow people to express themselves, speak freely and find closure. Sometimes, just letting it out can help them feel better.</p>
