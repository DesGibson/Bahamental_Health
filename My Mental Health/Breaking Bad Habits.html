            <b>So Close Yet So Far</b><br><br><br>
         So close to the finish line,<br>
         Yet so far from my goal.<br>
         Procrastination is a theif,<br>
         All the time from me she stole.<br><br> 
     
         The deadline is quickly approaching,<br>
         But I have yet to achieve my aim.<br>
         I try to make some progress,<br>
         But my effort remains the same. <br><br>
     
         Perseverance and diligence knock at my door,<br>
         But laziness has me trapped in a coma.<br>
         I try to awake from my slumber,<br>
         But I am entangled by his sweet aroma.<br><br> 
     
         The fragrance of freedom,<br>
         To do what I chose.<br>
         So focused on what I could gain,<br>
         That I forget what I'll lose.<br><br> 
     
         What happened to the plans I made?<br>
         How could I let myself forget?<br>
         All the time spent chasing this temporary dream,<br>
         Will only lead to permanent regret.<br><br><br><br>

                The Gospel of Inclusion
            </h2>
            <p>
                So, I know that many Christians in this generation grew up with the message of "Do what makes you happy" and "Once you're 'saved', you can do whatever you want to do".  A lot of us who grew up hearing it, believed it -including me. We were taught that it's okay to spend our entire days wasting time, as long as we read our bible before we went to bed at night. We were told that if we were going to spend 10 hours each day watching tv, smoking, drinking, partying and listening to worldly music, we should at least spend 10 minutes with God. However, many of us took this too literally. We would spend our entire days wasting time doing whatever our 'feelings' led us to do, but just when it's time for bed, we pick up our bible (or open our bible app) and pick the shortest psalm we could find (or verse of the day) to read, pray The Lord's Prayer (Our Father Prayer) and go to bed. This is what many Christians (young and old) believed was all they had to do to be saved.

                The Problem
            </h2>
            <p>
                However, they were quite far from it. Mark 12:30 tells us that we should love the Lord with all our hearts, minds and souls. So, when you think about it, does 10 minutes a day really serve this verse justice? Some of us may choose to commit half of our day, or most of our day, to God, but Mark 12:30 is saying that, as Christians, our entire day must be committed to God. When we sing songs like 'He Wants it All', by Forever Jones, 'It all Belongs to You' by Damita Haddon, 'I'm Yours', by Casey J and 'I Surrender All to Thee My Precious Saviour', are we singing these songs in all honesty and sincerity? Have we truly, fully committed our lives to Christ? Are we really saved?</p>
